# PSGridScroll

PSGridScroll is a view control that lays out a list of child views into a scrollable grid.  


# Example Project

There is an iPad example application to demonstrate the features of PSGridScroll.


# Status

PSGridScroll should be considered an simple solution for automatically displaying an arbitrary number of similar sized objects in a vertical scrolling grid. 

This project follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) standard. The API may change in backwards-incompatible ways before the 1.0 release.

The goal of PSGridScroll is to build a UI view container designed specifically for the iPad.


# Documentation

You can generate documentation with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). The example project includes a documentation build target.

Documentation is a work in progress.
